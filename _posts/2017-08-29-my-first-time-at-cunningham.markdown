Out past the courts of Flushing Meadows and beyond the Kissena velodrome, way way out in Queens you'll find the expansive Cunningham Park. Following the Clearview Expressway from it's Southern terminus at the Grand Central Parkway all the way North to it's interchange with the Long Island Expressway Cunningham Park is dotted with countless tennis courts and baseball diamonds, and nestled into the off-ramps of the Long Island Expressway and straddling the Clearview Expressway at the north-end of the park, there is a mountain bike park with singletrack; miles of singletrack.

Where 67th Street comes to an end at 210th Avenue there is a small break in rusted guard-rail flanked by signs welcoming you to Cunningham Park and warning you that Mountain Biking can lead to serious injury and a gentle reminder that 911 is the number to call should this happen. Behind these signs and over a log notched from years of cyclists riding it and you'll find you're in a forrest with trails leading out straight ahead and to the left, both returning via a trail from the right.

While some of the park's features look pretty gnarly, 100% of the park is ride-able on a cross bike and that's just what my friend and fellow coalition club member Riley and I did this past Sunday, because #crossiscoming.

### The Near-Side Trails

A small overpass connects the two halves of the park over Clearview Expressway. On the near side of the expressway you'll find rocky dirt trails with plenty of roots and several different difficulty options. For cross bike-handling you'll get your best work in at Cunningham by choosing the blue (more difficult) and black (most difficult) trail options on the near-side of the Clearview Expressway. The narrow dirt track eases you into the park with few roots and rocks as it winds it's way towards towards the first "more difficult" optional section.

At this point you're thinking, it's kind of amazing this place exists ... it's "nice" to ride and it sure is pretty.

Turning onto the first "more difficult" section, you'll start to encounter a variety of mandatory technical features that will begin to test your handling skills. There are a few small rock gardens, and a series of graduated logs that will test your bunny hop and manual skills

alternatively offer you the opportunity to practice your dismount and remount. Turning onto the "most difficult" bits and your nerve will be tested as much as your balance, with rooted and rutted roll-downs and ride-ups.

### Getting Rad on the Far Side

So we had done a few laps on the near-side and turned left onto a bit asphalt that lead us to an overpass dumping us out on a web of overgrown paths, some paved, some dirt. While rolling around getting our bearings a [Velo Classic](https://veloclassicstans.com/) rider and a Kissena rider rolled through asking us if this was the way back to the easy trails. They looked exhausted. After rolling around for a bit, we found ourselves at the top of a steep drop-in to a gnarly pump-track, and we started to understand.

And the first time I rode it on my cross bike is the first time I've ever said gnarly unironically. This bit was 1 part terrifying and 5 parts fun on a cross bike, or maybe the reverse of that. It's definitely the feature that will keep me coming back, because we definitely did not get it right ... and it wasn't for lack of trying.

For Riley and I both it was our first time at a pump track. It's one of those things where you can tell there is a really elegant solution, but you just can't wrap your head around it.

And that solution almost-certainly has to do with more speed more fluidly applied, but neither of us had done our homework at that point and so neither of us was prepared. We were also too busy in awe of this park that existed here in Queens, and too busy acting like kids who just discovered they can skid out on their stomper brakes.

Beyond the pump-track there's quite a bit more challenging trail on the far side, with steeper bits with roots and off-camber descents and some smallish mandatory drops. It has some grind-it-out ride-ups and some lesser-maintained side-trails suitable for run-up practice.

It's a higher-risk, higher-fun situation on the far side of the expressway, and while next time I'm back I'll spend more of my time working on my cross technique on the near-side loop, I'll spend more time dreaming of getting rad on the far side.

### Oh Yeah, We're Coming Back

And we're coming back again on cross bikes, because this is the most fun I've ever had on 2 wheels inside the city, and it's pretty close to the most fun I've had on two wheels ever. So every weekend we're not racing, we'll have a contingency of CCC riders shredding the gnar under the canopy of Cunningham Park.
