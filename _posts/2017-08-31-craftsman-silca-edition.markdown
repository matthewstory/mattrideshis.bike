Out of all the bike stuff I've accumulated, none generates more interest than this DIY cordless air compressor. Whether it's helping my friend [Roman](https://instagram.com/romanshotthis) convert to tubeless, or bringing it to cross practice, this little tool generates a lot of interest wherever it goes. And I can understand why: It's cool AF, super precise, and finally eliminates the last need for arm muscles among cyclists.

If you don't have a battery and charger already, this project might be a bit on the pricey side, but the conversion is easy to do and the results are rad and in my opinion worth the spend.

### Goals & Credit Where Credit is Due

When I built this compressor I had one goal: Have an air compressor that I could use both at home and at Cross Races that would work to both set tubeless tires and help [Coalition CC](https://instagram.com/coalitioncyclingclub) riders dial-in their pressure on tubeless and tubular setups alike.

Initially I was going to buy a proper air compressor, [with a tank](http://amzn.to/2wGI1XD) like you would see on a construction site. This is actually a pretty cost-effective option, though it's super heavy and not very precise. Luckily my friend [Clay](https://instagram.com/clayparkerjones) pointed me in the direction of a great article from CX magazine on doing a similar [conversion](https://www.cxmagazine.com/craftsman-cordless-inflator-dials-psi-presta-tires-minimal-conversion) on an older model.

### Conversion

First things first, unscrew the read cap and remove the hose. Unfortunately I didn't take pictures of the original braided hose, but the mechanics are the same as the new hose.

Pull the hose out from the red nozzle. This may result in the black rubber gasket that holds the barb at the end of the hose falling off. If this happens take the gasket and seat it back inside the compressor nozzle itself (not the red attachment cap).

Next you are going to remove the barb from the factory hose. The barb is the piece that attaches the hose to the compressor through the red cap that we just screwed. To do this you'll need to cut the hose, and use tin-snips to remove the clamp at the end of the hose (again sorry for the lack of pictures). Don't be afraid to get a bit rough, you can't damage the barb and we're going to discard the factory hose anyway.

Once you've removed the barb discard the factory hose, push the barb into the silca hose and using pliers tighten the clamp around the outside of the new silca hose to secure the barb in place. It'll end up looking like this:

On the other end of the hose, insert the [Schrader](http://amzn.to/2gnLGmX) chuck barb into the hose and use pliers to tighten the clamp around the outside of the new silca hose to secure the chuck barb in place:

Then thread the [Presta Head](http://amzn.to/2xvnl2) onto the Schrader chuck:

And you're good to go.

### Use

The Silca head slips on and off easily, there are no levers to depress and no threads to screw on just push it on and then put some pressure on the side of the head and pull to remove:

The digital pressure display is really the killer feature of this unit:

With precision to a tenth of a PSI and an easy to read display, you'll get exactly the pressure you're looking for every time, there's no guess work involved.

And that's it. I hope you build one for yourself, and if you do please send me pictures!
