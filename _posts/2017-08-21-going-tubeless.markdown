I am by no means a tubeless zealot, and I spend most of my year riding on clinchers with tubes or tubulars. But when it gets to that shreddy time of year and you start ripping trails, tubeless is by far your best option, and with more and more manufacturers ensuring their clinchers are tubeless-ready there's a good chance you've already got the rims for the job. This guide will walk you through doing your first tubeless conversion in less than an hour and for less than $50 (assuming your tires and rims are compatible).
### Why Tubeless

My first trail ride of the year with [Roman](https://instagram.com/romanshotthis) was before either of us got our tubeless setup going for the year, and we got a flat a piece in less than fifty miles of fairly non-technical dirt. If this sounds high, it's not. Flats on tubed clinchers are pretty common. We had three flats on four tubed clinchers on our first [Coalition CC](https://instagram.com/coalitioncyclingclub) trail ride of the year on that same trail. That adds up to a little more than 2 hours of navel-gazing trail-side, four canisters of spent CO<sup>2</sup> and three used tubes in a little under seven hours. While much has been written on how supple tubeless tires feel (and they do feel supple), the real reason to go tubeless off-road is to eliminate pinch-flats and to drastically reduce the chance of puncture flats while out on the trail, which means less time and money spent on fixing them. While you can get many of the same benefits from tubulars, the additional expense, time and difficulty repairing trail-side make tubeless a far more convenient option for non-race riding.

### Before We Start: Find an Air Compressor

Going tubeless is easy as long as you have access to an air compressor. I personally use a modified craftsman [cordless air compressor](https://www.cxmagazine.com/craftsman-cordless-inflator-dials-psi-presta-tires-minimal-conversion), but this setup is easy enough to do outside of your local bike shop with outdoor compressor access (both [King Kog](https://www.google.com/maps/place/KING+KOG/@40.7189972,-73.9475264,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2595035e6acc9:0xa36dab8735b2d229!8m2!3d40.7189972!4d-73.9453324) and [R&A](https://www.google.com/maps/place/R%26A+Cycles/@40.6793937,-73.9804029,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25babeb818c35:0xf9e838988302c4cb!8m2!3d40.6793937!4d-73.9782089) in Brooklyn have this) or at a local gas station with a simple [Presta valve adapter](https://www.rei.com/product/857301/slime-presta-valve-adapter).

### Preparing the Wheel

Make sure you have a tubeless compatible rim.

And then check to see if the rim has been sealed with tubeless rim tape rather than a rim strip. Some manufacturers -- like HiFi -- ship the rim with tubeless tape, but many -- like HED and ENVE -- do not. Tubeless rim tape is usually a shiny yellow, and will go all the way across the base of the rim from lip to lip, rather than being a fabric-like finish that just covers the spoke-holes. If you have any doubt, then you'll need to mask the rim with a tubeless rim tape.

For more on correctly installing the rim tape, see the video provided by [Stan's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uHQ4csS1yM). Once you're sure you have a tubeless compatible rim and proper rim tape, take your tubeless valves:

![Stan's No Tubes Valves`]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/tubeless/valves.jpg" | relative_url }})

And remove the nut. Push the valve through the rim at the valve hole until the rubber seal is firmly in contact with the rim. Thread the nut back onto the valve and hand-tighten to the rim.

### Installing the Tire

Before we get started with the tire, make sure it's tubeless compatible. Bad things happen if you try to install non-tubeless tires tubeless-ly. Most tubeless tires will advertise their tubeless-ness right on the tire:

![Tubeless Ready Clement]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/tubeless/tire.jpg" | relative_url }})

Install the tire the same way you would install a regular clincher tire. Bear in mind this might take a bit more effort than you are used to, but resist the urge to pry the tire onto the rim with your tire-levers as you risk damaging the rim-tape or stretching the tire bead.

### Sealant

Start by removing the valve core. There is a special-made tool for [doing this](http://amzn.to/2wj8tXn), but honestly pliers work just fine.

![Remove Core with Pliers]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/tubeless/remove-core-1.jpg" | relative_url }})

Look for the spot where the valve stem narrows. Just above the spot where this narrows you'll see a spot where the valve is flattened on two sides. Grip here to unscrew the valve core with a pair of pliers. Once done, you can pull the core out:

![Remove Core with Pliers]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/tubeless/remove-core-2.jpg" | relative_url }})

Now we're going to take our sealant, shake it up and measure out 2 ounces.

![Stan's No Tubes Sealant]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/tubeless/sealant.jpg" | relative_url }})


I do this by using an old [Stan's 2 oz bottle](http://amzn.to/2vYzxIY), but many people find it useful to use a specially designed [injector](http://amzn.to/2vZ3s3x).

Before we move forward be sure that the beads on each side of the tire are straddling the rubber valve seal. We're about to pour sealant into the tire through the valve ... so if this isn't positioned correctly you're going to make quite the mess. You can check the position by first looking to see if any rubber stopper is visible around the tire, and then by pinching the tire around the valve stopper to ensure it's positioned in the middle.

Position the wheel with the valve at the bottom of the wheel (6 o'clock) and carefully start to inject the sealant into the tire through the stem:


![Stan's No Tubes Sealant]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/tubeless/sealant-in-valve.jpg" | relative_url }})

If sealant starts to leak through the valve or the tire bead pick the wheel up and rotate it to distribute the sealant throughout the tire. Then continue to add sealant until the full 2 ounces are in the tire.

### Seating the Bead

Screw the valve core back into the valve and tighten it with your pliers or valve core tool. Open the valve cap, and if you are at a gas station attach your Schrader valve adapter to your valve head. We are now going to use the air compressor to inflate to the minimum pressure listed on the tire. For Clement PDX this is 35 PSI.

![Pump It Up]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/tubeless/pump.jpg" | relative_url }})

Along the way you should hear some popping, this is good. That is the tire bead seating to the rim. and it's exactly what you want. This step of the process is by far the most likely place for things to start to go wrong. If you got your tire up to the minimum PSI, skip to the next section. If you're having trouble getting it up to the minimum PSI let's walk through some of the more common problems you'll likely run into:

1. If air is escaping from the valve hole even at very low PSIs (like 10 psi or lower) you probably need to stop and tighten the valve.
1. If air starts to escape from the valve hole at higher PSIs, or if you've tightened the valve already and air is still escaping, you probably need to re-tape your rim.
1. If air is escaping from the bead, use a brush and apply soapy water to both sides of the wheel at the spot where the bead meets the tire. This will help to keep the rim sealed initially and also show you where air is escaping. If air continues to escape:
  * inspect your rim to ensure it is not damaged.
  * inspect the tire to ensure it's not damaged
  * if neither is damaged you may need a more powerful air compressor or a [2-stage pump](http://amzn.to/2vYF6aj) to seat your tire. Best thing to do is to take it to your local bike shop to use their indoor compressor. If that doesn't work, they can help you diagnose what is wrong.

### Burping and Final Steps

Once the tire is seated bounce it off the ground a few times and rotate the wheel. Rotating the wheel distributes the sealant. While bouncing the tire you may hear more popping as the tire seats fully. Once the tire is properly seated and holding air you can switch to using a normal pump. Using a normal pump or compressor carefully inflate the tire to the maximum advertised pressure, and bounce it off the ground a few times again.

At this point the best thing you can do is to ride your bike around the block a few times to continue distributing the sealant, and then you're good to go.

### Ongoing Maintenance and Trail-side Flat Repair

It's a good idea the morning after your install to check your tire pressure to see how much you lost over night. You should not have lost much, so if you lost more than 10 - 15 PSI you probably want to add more sealant. You also want to make an effort to add sealant every 4 - 6 weeks as a matter of habit.

On the off-chance that you do catch a flat on the trail there are a couple of options. The standard practice is to carry a few spare tubes and to just put a tube in and ride with a tube until you get home. In this case repairing a flat is the same as on a normal clincher ... just a touch messier. An alternative approach is to use a special [tubeless puncture repair kit](http://amzn.to/2wiQSyT) to repair the hole in the tire itself.
