I've never built a bike from the ground up before, and to be honest it took some convincing from my friends before I built up this Swiss Cross. At the time I was coming off my first CX race weekend on a borrowed Space Horse and was eager to get my own steed to race for the rest of the year. I was looking at the sort of mid-level (2 - 3K) complete build CX bikes that are popular right now: carbon frames, 1X drive-trains and disc brakes. I had recently test driven a Felt F4X at NYCVelo, and if it hadn't been for the terrible paint job I would probably have bought it and had a perfectly OK bike.

Instead of perfectly OK, I ended up with a truly special bike and it all starts in details. Take the Felt F4X. The major selling points of the F4X are it's carbon frame, Hydraulic disc brakes, thru axles and a SRAM Force CX1 drive-train. There's a lot to like there to be sure, but let's take a closer look at that "Force CX1" drive-train, comprised of a Force 1X rear derailleur, a Rival cassette, brakes, shift/brake levers, cassette, chain and S350 cranks. This build means that the only part of the drive-train that lives up to the hype -- the rear derailleur -- is also the most likely to break in a race and need replacing.

Total control over the selection of every component is ultimately what sold me on building this bike from the ground up, and actually selecting the components and building it with my friends [Clay](https://instagram.com/clayparkerjones) and [Cullen](https://instagram.com/cullenmacdonald) from [Coalition CC](https://instagram.com/coalitioncyclingclub) is what convinced me that building your own is not only better than buying off the rack, it's easier than you think.

### Picking Your Parts

Before we get into parts selection, I want to call out the table above. This table includes every part required to build my Ritchey Swiss Cross to spec and links to purchase all of these parts online. This will be a staple of all my gear reviews, and is fundamental to our open source approach to building and riding bikes at Coalition CC. If you have questions on the tools or techniques required to assemble these parts, please leave a comment with your question and I'll do my best to point you in the right direction.

I built this Swiss Cross up to race CX, which means that I'm going to crash it a lot and then have to fix it in a parking lot far away from my local bike shop. Crashing it a lot means that the parts most likely to break need to be cheap and easy to replace. Fixing it in a parking lot means that I need to be able to service the bike myself, which means no fancy proprietary parts (sorry Hydraulic disc). Eventually racing CX means that the total build cost needs to be cheap enough that I can affort to have a pit bike.

#### Drivetrain




Much like the F4X, my Swiss Cross build has a mixed SRAM drive-train, but unlike the F4X, I chose to use Rival in all the places that are going to break -- the shift/brake levers and rear derailleur -- and Force everywhere else. I chose to go with an 42t cog on the crank with an 11 - 36t cassette, rather than the 40t/11 - 32t you often see in order to give me a bit more speed when using the bike on the road down hills. This extra speed at the top end of the range has allowed me to use this bike on the road during the winter or in a pinch during the season. The downside of the 11 - 36t cassette is that some of the jumps between cogs are pretty severe.

#### Wheels & Tires

The HiFi mixtape alloy rims on this bike are tubeless ready, bombproof and pretty cost-effective ($519 - $829) when you compare them to the fairly similar [Ardennes](https://www.hedcycling.com/ardennes/) builds from Hed ($700 - $1200). The HiFi alloy rims feature a rim width of 24mm, which is less than the 25mm sported by their carbon rims and the Belgium rims used on the Ardennes which is one of the very few things I would change about these wheels.

For city and gravel riding I run Compass Bon Jon Pass lightweight tires tubeless with Stan's valves. Though the walls are so thin that you'll need to use more sealant than you think, once you get a good seal it's like riding on two pillows made out of clouds of butter and silk. I can't really say enough good things about these tires.

#### Cockpit

I chose to use Richey WCS Alloy components for the cockpit because it's cheap and lightweight. The seatpost and stem have been great, but the bars are flexible to the point of "bendy" being a word I've used more than once. Fizik saddle and bar-tape are a staple on all my bikes currently and this one is no different.

The XTR pedals were a completely unnecessary but fairly cheap upgrade from the XT and one of the few "splurges" on this bike.

### The Results

The first thing that makes me happy about this bike is just looking at it. It's just right. Take a step back and the bike as a whole works, the proportions are right, the paint is right, the wheels with the gumwalls are right. Take a step forward and every component is exactly what you want and matchey-matchey.

Then I ride it, and it gets even better. The bike feels race-y but comfortable at the same time. The steel frame eats up the road, but when I put my foot down it doesn't sap my power. For a steel bike, you might expect it to be heavy but the full build clocks in at a very respectable 18lbs, which goes a long way to explaining why the bike still feels nimble and spry.

Ultimately the thing I like the most is that it is 100% my bike, I know it like the back of my hand because I built it with my own two hands. And because of this I can tinker a lot more with it than I hae with other bikes. Want to try new bars? Easy. Change the fit with a longer stem? No problem. Don't like it? Just switch back. My Swiss Cross has gone beyond being static and become a living and evolving bike.
