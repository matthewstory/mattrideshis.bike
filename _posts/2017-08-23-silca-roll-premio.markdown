Before we descend into my own cognative dissonence surrounding this product I want to start by stating two things very clearly.

1. I love Silca.
2. Do not buy the Seat Roll Premio.


### Stability (1/5)

I love Silca because their products are always stunning, built to last a lifetime and consistently better than their competition. I love Silca so much that the first, second and third time I had problems with this bag I assumed that it was me. I must have attached it improperly. This can't be the bag, it's too awesome. I believe in Silca; their magic is real; it has to be me.

But it's now nearly a year later and I've logged more than 8,000 miles with this sleek, low-profile bag nestled under my saddle and I've had more than a few group-rides interrupted because the Seat Roll Premio is as temperamental as it is stunning. It has a tendency to ... "flip-out".

And it's not just my bag, every rider I have met on the road with this bag over the past year has experienced this same failure, and more than once I've seen a rider out on 9W dragging their Premio roll behind them by the Premio boa.

Worse-yet, the thin elastic strap is not strong enough to keep the seat roll seat-rolled when dangling precariously from the rails of your saddle and so once it's upside-down the seat roll quickly becomes a seat flap:

I have personally had to replace a set of tire levers and a multi-tool because of this, and if you think I'm the only one that's lost gear becasue of this, think again. Here's another Seat Roll Premio user recounting the first time he used the product:

> The first time I used it it flew open and sent my stuff flying across Main Street.

But perhaps more surprising than how common this complete failure of design seems to be, is how complete the denial of the bag owners (including myself) is. Here's the full quote from the above owner in context:

> Good to see another Silca roll user. Literally the most beautiful accessory I own! ... The first time I used it it flew open and sent my stuff flying across ... Main Street.

And I completely understand this. I have found myself defending my stops to fix or check my bag to my friends repeatedly by saying similar things, because it is so damn cool.

### Cool (5/5)

Silca is probably the closest thing we have in the cycling world to Supreme. They have a lot of limited releases at staggeringly high prices which sell out nearly instantaneously. Everything they make seems to have next-level HypeBeast status. And personally, I believe that's rightfully so. Everything they make is stunning, period. Every limited edition ultra-premium pump they put out teams up with a Pegorretti or a Sachs, and it's probably the closest most of us will ever get to owning something by one of these artists.

Silca is a lifestyle brand that also happens to make some of the best quality pumps and tools in the world. And so at $50, why not buy one of the few attainably-priced pieces they offer? Tack on another $50 and they'll throw in a pretty amazing CO<sup>2</sup> regulator and multi-tool for you as well. And at first glance, the Seat Roll Premio lives up to the Silca standards, because it is stunning.

### Looks (4/5)

When you look closely at the seat roll you notice the white cross-stitching over the waxed black canvas and the hints of red in the boa and strap. It is minimal and perfect. Far more important than the detail work are how closely your friends will have to look to observe them.

The low profile of the Seat Roll Premio makes it nearly invisible unless you're looking for it, and invisible should be the goal of a well-designed saddle bags. The lining is also pretty sweet:

### Capacity (3/5)

Silca claims it can fit 2 CO<sup>2</sup> cartridges, a regulator, a multi-tool and a tube (up to 42mm). I've never been able to get that second CO<sup>2</sup> cartridge in, but still find the bag to be plenty spacious for most of my ride needs:

My bag holds:

* A high-volume [20g CO<sup>2</sup> cartridge](http://amzn.to/2g2TH0t)
* Planet-Bike CO<sup>2</sup> [inflator head](http://amzn.to/2g3GCDT) (ever since my [Lezyne](http://amzn.to/2xrjClV) fell out!)
* Park Tool [Tire Levers](http://amzn.to/2g3Tkmd) (ever since my [Pedros levers](http://amzn.to/2ipb6Rv) fell out!)
* Crank Brothers [Multi-Tool](http://amzn.to/2xrd1HW)
* Park Tool [Patch Kit](http://amzn.to/2xb8fiJ)
* A Tube (depends on which bike)

### Durability (5/5)

I've ridden for more than 8,000 miles with this bag both on and off road, in good and bad weather through all seasons, and while the cover gets muddy and wet, once you open the roll it still looks as good as new.

Like every other Silca product I've tried, the Seat Roll Premio was engineered to last a long time, even in harsh conditions. It's as durable as it is cool, it's just unfortunate that it doesn't stay put more often.
