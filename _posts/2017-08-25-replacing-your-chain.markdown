Keeping your drive-train in good working order is vital to your [safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504U_9yHYE8) and [speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7FxZ1kFIW0). Outside of regularly [cleaning](http://amzn.to/2gaIRpe) and lubricating your drive-train the most common bit of maintenance you'll need to do is replacing your chain.

This How To will walk you through replacing a SRAM PowerLink chain. If you're riding a Shimano chain stay-tuned for a forthcoming connector pin how-to.

### When To Change Your Chain

I would recommend picking up a [chain checker](http://amzn.to/2wveK2i), which is a tool that will tell you when you need to swap chains. But absent that, it's a safe assumption that you should swap your chain out every 2,000 miles or so.

### Removing the Old Chain

First you'll want to slack the chain, so put your bike in the smallest cog on the rear cassette and shift into the little chainring if you have a front derailleur. If your Rear Derailleur has a cage lock:

![Rear Derailleur]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/01-rear-derailleur.jpg" | relative_url }})

Then engage it by pressing the ðŸ”’ button and pivoting the bottom of the cage forward until it locks and the derailleur is de-tensioned and remove the back wheel:

![Clutch]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/02-rear-derailleur-clutched.jpg" | relative_url }})

Find the PowerLink link in the chain. It looks a little different than the other links as it has a small slot behind the connecting pin:

![PowerLink]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/03-powerlink.jpg" | relative_url }})

Using your needle-nose pliers you're going to pinch the two pins toward each other on this link, which will cause the PowerLink to open. Once this is open pull the chain out of the drive-train but do not discard it.

### Deep Clean

Before we get to the new chain, let's take the opportunity to do a detailed clean. To do this you'll  need degreaser. I like [Pedro's Oranj Peelz](http://amzn.to/2vby6JZ):

![Degreaser]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/05-degreaser.jpg" | relative_url }})

But you can use whichever brand you prefer. Soak a rag or old T-shirt in degreaser and hand-clean the Pulleys on your Rear Derailleur:

![Clean]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/06-clean.jpg" | relative_url }})

Also take the opportunity to really clean the teeth on your chainring(s) and to hand-clean your cassette.

### Installing the New Chain

Take your new PowerLink chain:

![New Force Chain]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/04-new-chain.jpg" | relative_url }})

And lay it out next to the old chain to get the length right:

![Measure It]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/07-measure.jpg" | relative_url }})

Mark the link where you're going to cut the new chain to make it the same length as the old chain, and get out your chain breaking tool:

![Chain Breaking Tool]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/08-breaker-of-chains.jpg" | relative_url }})

Position the pin in the tool and screw the handle in until the pin pushes all the way out the other side (this could take a bit of force, but not too much):

![Breaking the Chain]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/09-breaking-the-chain.jpg" | relative_url }})

Next you need to thread the chain back through the drivetrain. SRAM chains aren't directional (unlike Shimano chains), but the PowerLink is. There is an arrow on the PowerLink, make sure this arrow is pointing in the direction the chain rotates (towards the front of the bike above the chain-stays, towards the bottom of the bike below the chain-stays).

If you have a front derailleur, make sure the chain goes through the front derailleur (not under it) over the chain-stay and then thread the chain through the pulleys like this:

![Routing the Chain]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/10-routing-the-chain.jpg" | relative_url }})

Then we take the other half of the PowerLink and slide slide the pins on both sides into each slot. Verify that the arrow on the PowerLink is pointing the right way now on both sides of the chain.

Re-mount the wheel and then "set" the PowerLink by holding the rear brake and pushing the crank arm forward. This will tension the chain and ensure the PowerLink pins are fully slotted in:

### Lubricate the Chain

Final step is to lubricate the chain:

![Chain Lube]({{ "/assets/posts/howto/chain/12-grease.jpg" | relative_url }})

Putting a dot of grease on each pin of the chain. That's it! You're good to go.
